![Wind Speed Impact](https://superinspectionpros.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how-high-does-wind-speed-need-to-be-to-damage-a-home_orig.jpg)

📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting wind speed values using machine learning techniques. A Decision Tree Regressor was applied to a dataset containing weather-related variables, with the goal of accurately forecasting wind speed based on other available environmental features.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes multiple columns representing weather data such as:

Temperature

Humidity

Pressure

Dew Point

Wind Direction

Wind Speed

The data was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure consistency and quality for the modeling stage.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📈 Model Used
Decision Tree Regressor

Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to capture non-linear relationships without requiring feature scaling.

🔍 Workflow Summary
Data Loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Splitting the data into training & testing sets

Model Training using Decision Tree Regressor

Model Evaluation using metrics like MSE & R²

Visualizing Predictions vs. Actual Values

📊 Key Findings
The Decision Tree model managed to capture trends in wind speed prediction effectively.

Further tuning or trying ensemble methods like Random Forest could improve accuracy.
